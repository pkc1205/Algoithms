Deleting a Node from the Linked List (assuming values in Data are unique)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedure Delete(Value)
Pointer : Found 'Pointer for finding required Node to Delete
Found = NULL 'Assuming required Node not found
If there are no Nodes in the List then
 Output error message that can't delete a Node
Otherwise
 Go to memory location pointed by Start pointer 'Begin at the Start (first Node)
 Start Loop and run until Next points to NULL 'Check each Node until Next pointer points to NULL
 If value in Data of current Node is equal to Value then 'If we find our required Node
 Found = current Node 'Mark the current Node with Found pointer
 Exit Loop 'No need to finish the loop
 Endif
 Go to Node pointed by Next pointer of current Node
 End Loop
 If the required Node is the first Node in the List then
 Point the Start pointer to NULL 'Node deleted
 Otherwise
 Point Next of previous Node to the Node pointed by Next of Found 'Node deleted (Previous.Next = Found.Next)
 Endif
Endif
End Procedure
