Binary Trees
==========
Structure of Binary Tree Node
Integer : Data
Pointer : Left
Pointer : Right
Pointer : Start
Pointer : Current
Start = NULL
Current = NULL
Insertion in a Binary Tree
------------------------------
Procedure Insertion(Value)
Create a New Node
Point its Left and Right pointers to NULL
If Start is pointing to NULL then
 Point Start to the New Node 'Tree was empty so insert at Start
Otherwise
 Current = Start 'Search for appropriate position
 Start Loop at Current and run until Left and Right pointers are NULL
 If data in Value is less than or equal to Data in Current Node then
 Go to the left of the Current Node
 Otherwise
 Go to the right of the Current Node
 Endif
 If data in New Node is less than data in Current Node then
 Point the Left pointer of Current Node to the New Node
 Otherwise
 Point the Right pointer of Current Node to the New Node
 Endif
 Insert data in Value in the New Node
 End Loop
Endif
End Procedure
