Linked List
==========
Declaring a Linked List
-----------------------------
Integer : Data
Pointer: Next
Declaring variables
-----------------------
Pointer : Start
Start = NULL 'Nothing in the Linked List
Creating a New Node with above structure.
---------------------------------------------------
Procedure Create(Value)
If there is enough memory available then 'Only create a Node if memory is available
 Create New Node in memory 'Creating a New Node for the Linked List
 Point its Next pointer to NULL 'Making a termination point for the Node
 If this is the first Node in the List then 'There must be a starting point for the Linked List
 Point Start to the Node 'Point Start to New Node only if it is the very first one
 Otherwise 'If other Nodes exist then find the last Node in the List
 Go to memory location pointed by Start pointer 'Begin at the Start (first Node)
 Start Loop and run until Next points to NULL 'Check each Node until Next pointer points to NULL
 Go to the Node pointed by Next pointer 'Move from Node to Node
 End Loop
 Point Next of last Node to the newly created Node 'When last Node found, point its Next pointer to New Node
 Put data in Value in new Node's Data 'Put the required data (Value) in New Node's Data variable
 Endif
Otherwise 'Out of memory. Can't create a New Node
 Output error message that there is no more memory available
EndIf
End Procedure
