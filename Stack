Stacks
======
We need two variables. One for the maximum limit of the Stack (MAX) and the other for
keeping track of the current element to be manipulated (Current). We also declare an array
for the Stack.
MAX = 5
Current = 0
Array Stack[MAX] 'This will declare an array with 5 elements.
Inserting a Value onto the Stack (Push)
-----------------------------------------
Procedure Push (Value)
If Current is equal to MAX then 'This means no more space for data. Stack is full.
 Output an error that the Stack is full 'Display an error message that there is no more space on the Stack.
Else
 Add 1 to Current 'Go to the next available element in the Stack.
 Put data in Value into current position 'Put (Push) the data sent in Value parameter in the new element.
Endif
End Procedure
Displaying a value from the Stack (Pop)
-----------------------------------------
Procedure Pop
if Current is equal to Zero then 'If there are no values in the Stack.
 Output error that Stack is empty 'Nothing to output.
Else
 Output value from Stack at Current position 'Output (POP) a value in the Current element (LIFO).
 Subtract 1 from Current
Endif
End Procedure
